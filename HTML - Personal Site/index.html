        <p><em>Computer Science Student and former Helicopter Mechanic.</em></p>
        <p> I am a Computer Science student at Indiana-University Purdue-University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and former Helicopter Mechanic in the United States Marine Corps.
            I enjoy learning and applying technical concepts and expressing my creativity through these applications.
            I find data structures and algorithms critical to this field but my artistic interests lead me to pursue Front-end Web Development.
